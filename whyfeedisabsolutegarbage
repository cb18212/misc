Anderson was trying to hard to be 'groovy' and sound like a teenager. I can't blame him though because he is 45 and lives in Massachusetts. Maybe if this was written from a speaker who isn't as dumb as a freaking door and experience what actual teenagers are like then, I might have enjoyed this book ...  This book is tacky and I hate it. I would never recommend this book to anyone. In fact, I am going to give this book to someone I hate as a present so they can experience the same pain I felt while forcing myself to read.

The slang, which could have been interesting had it been done properly, was confusing and unhelpful. The voice of "Titus" sounded like some strange mix between a modern-day valley girl and a whiny futuristic boy. The word "like" was incorporated infinitely more than it should have been. There was very little amount of character development. Titus starts the story as a bratty teenager, and he ends it as a bratty teenager. His friends are incredibly flat. Violet and her father, the only mildly interesting characters, seem to have little impact on Titus' life.

I was honestly hoping for a revolution book.

I was hoping this strange world of Brain Internets was a terrifying dystopian setting, set perfectly for our main character to rise up against the power that be.

Instead, I get a plot which could have easily taken place modern-day, the main character being a snobby billionaire's kid and the antagonist being cancer.

I feel like this world has such possibilities, but the plot was awkwardly developed and the characters were Ew.

My rating:

one out of five stars

I hated this book. I felt patronized and belittled by his futile attempt to relate with me. This book has no content and the English was horrendous.

This book is trying to be some sort of modern 1984, but I was writing more complex and interesting (and much less annoying) stories in 6th grade. No, that is not an exaggeration. The author of this book may have a degree from Harvard, but they can't write for !@#$. If 1984 is a Ferrari then this book is a 40 year old car that doesn't have doors, a roof, a hood, or an engine, and was owned by a smoker with cancer until it was left to rot in a yard for decades until the rust overtook it. Unless you're into self inflicted headaches and poorly written boring stories, do yourself a favor and avoid this worthless excuse for a novel.

Reading the synopsis I thought it might actually be similar to the book I am trying to write, about being plugged in all the time. Gladly my book and this are not the same. At least not yet, and I hope to stay far far far away from his material. As in I will do a search for the word feed and delete it used in every occurrence ... There is no reader payoff. You put in the time and you read the words, but there is nothing in their to like, nothing to cheer for, no sense of hope. Just this eternal pit of stupidity and gloom.

Didn't finish... But it was awful! Want to mark it so I never read it again!

And finally my review:
This book is absolute garbage, it deserves to burn. There are about 8 uses of the f-word ON ONE PAGE. There is a sex scene in the middle and it is just a poorly written love story where the girlfriend dies at the end. There is almost nothing interesting in the book except for the pieces that the author COMPLETELY IGNORES. Then at the end he just has everyone start dying as their skin falls off. Bad book, should be banned from everywhere. I want to take this book, rip out it's bleeding spine and throw both of them into a fire as I watch it burn with hatred filling my eyes. I will be filled with rage for an our untill I am convinced that this book is dead.
